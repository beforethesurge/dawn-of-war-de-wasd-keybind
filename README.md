# Dawn of War Definitive Edition - WASD Keybinding

I customized Relics moddable keybindings from you having to hold down the Shift key to move the camera around (based off Modern preset)
- NOTE: Some abilities and build keys are still being updated to see what works best, as Shift+A or any of the other camera controls don't work for abilities/build orders
  - Will update when I experiment with it some more

## Contibutions

If you would like to contribute to this project, you're free to create a Pull Request and Issue
- Only condition is please justify the keybindings the best you can if you change them, as I'm trying to not cause too many conflicts with the default bindings that Relic has with its Modern preset
